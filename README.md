# Hello world!

(Yeah yeah, I know, that's a really cheesy opening. I just couldn't resist.)

I'm Eleanor (she/her) - I usually go by the username yambone or yambone635 online.

### What do you do?

I'm mainly a programmer, coding in...well, pretty much whatever language seems right for what I want to do. I've experimented with most of the big names, but I don't really have a specialty language. (Well, other than maybe C#. That was mostly an accident - I love making games, and C# happens to be the main language Unity uses.)

Although programming is my profession / main hobby, I love a lot of other computer-and-electronics related subjects too. Especially logic circuit design. That stuff is cool as fu- erm, really cool. As of writing, I'm working on finally learning Verilog so I can do an FPGA port of a CPU design I made for a course a long time ago. (Which is admittedly a little ambitious for a language I'm unfamiliar with, lol. We'll see how it goes. Even if it's a failure, I've found that for first forays into a new language / skill, the main thing that matters is that you're passionate about the project. Failure is fine, so long as you learn...and as long as no-one is paying you expecting results ;)

I enjoy a bunch of other crafty hobbies too (papercraft, knitting, soldering, etc), although of course not much of that is going to be represented on this GitHub page.

### How can I contact you?

If you want to reach me about something...well, sorry, there's not really a way to do that right now. I'm a bit paranoid about privacy, so I'm probably not going to link any social media here anytime soon. Maybe I'll set up a seperate email for that sort of thing, but no promises.
