# Hello world!

I'm Eleanor (she/her) - I usually go by the username yambone or yambone635 online.

### What do you do?

I'm mainly a programmer, coding in pretty much whatever language seems right for what I want to do. I've experimented with most of the big names, but I don't really have a specialty.

Although programming is my profession / main hobby, I love a lot of other computer-and-electronics related subjects too. Right now, I'm exploring digital circuits - as of writing, I'm working on finally learning Verilog so I can do an FPGA port of a CPU design I made for a course a long time ago. I'm also working on fixing up an old Commodore 64 so I can write a homebrew game and see what software developement was like "in the old days".

I enjoy a bunch of crafty hobbies as well (papercraft, knitting, soldering, etc), although of course not much of that is going to be represented on this GitHub page.

### How can I contact you?

At the moment, I don't have any public ways to contact me - however, I'll update this profile as soon as I do.
